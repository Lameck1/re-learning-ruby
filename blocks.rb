# Blocks can be passed to any method call, but the method needs to be set
# up to yield to the block or capture the block for it to be executed.

# 'yield' executes the block passed to the 'addition' method. The 'block_given?'
# method checks if a block was provided to avoid potential errors when no block is given.

# You can provide arguments to yield, and theyâ€™ll be passed to the block.
# Within the block, you list the names of the parameters to receive these
# arguments between vertical bars (|params...|).
